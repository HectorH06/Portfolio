        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> When I first created this page I was thinking of it like a mere porftolio. </p>
        <p> But with the time I was putting into it, and since I really like to decorate my projects, I decided to expand its purposes.</p>
        <p> You might read about my life, my projects and other things I've done. Art and literature </p>
        <h1>Design Philosophy</h1>
        <p> My intention, at least within this project, was to imbue my personality, through shapes, through colors. </p>
        <p> I tried to be as clean and minimalist as possible, but with colorful neon lights everywhere. </p>
        <p> About the structure, I looked around the net and saw many personal webpages, but the one that captured my attention the easiest was mitxela.com </p>
